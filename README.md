# Summer-Capstone - Rachel Wu

Capstone Project Idea:

Recipe Creator
- User inputs any ingredients that they have (like in their fridge, or in their house)
- From the input, it will recommend recipes that contains all ingredients listed

Features:
- Preference (having input user's food preferences, ex: spicy, sweet, savory)
- History
- Favorites
- Full Match + Partial Match
- Ratings + Reviews

Programming languages to use:
- Python
- Flask
- SQL
- HTML/ CSS
- Java + react (maybe)
